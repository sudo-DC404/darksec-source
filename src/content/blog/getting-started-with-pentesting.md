# Getting Started with Penetration Testing

Penetration testing, or pentesting, is the practice of testing computer systems, networks, and applications to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing is an authorized simulated cyber attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. This is different from a real attack because you have permission from the system owner.

## Essential Skills

To become a successful penetration tester, you need:

1. **Networking fundamentals** - Understanding TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS
2. **Operating systems** - Linux and Windows administration
3. **Programming** - Python, Bash scripting, PowerShell
4. **Web technologies** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL

## Getting Started

### 1. Learn the Basics

Start with understanding how networks and web applications work. Free resources like:
- OWASP Top 10
- Hack The Box
- TryHackMe

### 2. Set Up Your Lab

Create a safe environment to practice:
- Install VirtualBox or VMware
- Set up Kali Linux
- Deploy vulnerable machines (DVWA, Metasploitable)

### 3. Learn Essential Tools

Master these fundamental tools:
- **Nmap** - Network scanning
- **Burp Suite** - Web application testing
- **Metasploit** - Exploitation framework
- **Wireshark** - Network analysis

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

**IMPORTANT:** Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.

Always follow responsible disclosure practices when finding vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Practice on legal platforms (HTB, THM, VulnHub)
2. Learn about different attack vectors
3. Study for certifications (CEH, OSCP)
4. Join the security community
